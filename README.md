# cdn_assets

Easily include popular CDN assets (e.g. jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, Font Awesome, etc.) in your Ruby on Rails application.

This gem can definitely be used as a long-term solution if you're okay with the risks associated with having your assets served by a third party, but it's probably much more suited to those times when you just need to put something together *quickly* without hassle. Some example scenarios:

 * You need to rapidly prototype or demo something for your boss/client ASAP.
 * You read some blog post about how you can do X with Twitter Bootstrap and now you want to try for yourself.
 * Hackathons. _\*shudder*_

## Installation

Add this line to your application's *Gemfile*:

```ruby
gem 'cdn_assets'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```
